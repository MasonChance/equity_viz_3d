# Saving Strategies and Parameters

As a user I should be able to save my developed strategies with a unique name and be able to edit and apply them to any equity or test portfolio I develop or have previously developed.

I should be able to save my Test Portfolios and their parameters including any pre-saved strategies active on them.

I should also be able to save sets of analysis parameters for future use in analysis endeavors.
