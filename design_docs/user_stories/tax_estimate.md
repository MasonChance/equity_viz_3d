# Tax Estimator

As an active trader required to pay taxes on capital gains, I would like the ability to select a tax bracket and projected capital gains for a given test-portfolio and estimate the taxes owed at the end of a given test year.

The estimator should add up the total of all transactions executed for the portfolio, ignoring the total portfolio value at the end of the given test-period and apply the chosen tax rate.
