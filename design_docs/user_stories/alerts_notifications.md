# Alerts and Push Notifications

As an Active Equities Trader that doesn't use or have access to trading bots, I would like the option to set up SMS, Email, and or desktop alerts that notify me when a buy/sell trigger has occurred for an equity in my watchlist.

I would like to have an option to allow the application/alert watch to run in the background, even if my computer is in sleep mode.
