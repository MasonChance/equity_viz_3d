# Disk Space and Memory management

As a user with limited diskspace I would like the ability to explicitly set rules around how long the data for an equity I have analyzed is stored on my machine.

Options should include:

- Remove on Program close

- Remove after a number of days

- Maintain and update from web after number of days/hours/months etc.
