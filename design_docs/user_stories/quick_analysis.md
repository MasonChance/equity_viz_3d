# Quick Analysis Feature

As as user I want the ability to select an equity and run a quick analysis based on previously saved analysis parameters and see not only the chosen charts and data but a performance analysis of a saved portfolio with a given strategy active.

The workflow should be as follows:

1. Select Analysis parameters from saved list

1. Select Saved Porfolio from list

1. Select Saved Strategy from list

1. Select Time-Period to analyze

1. Display Analysis and Portfolio performance in seperate windows.
