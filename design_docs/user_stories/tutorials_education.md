# Tutorials and Tooltips

As a Novice investor, I would like to have access to a clear tutorial on the use of the app with an easily accessible help menu. I would like the option to enable tooltips regarding the information provided for the financial information that includes links and material references for further study.

**Example:**
I've searched an equity to evaluate and in the readout I see a figure with the label "D/E". I would like to be able to mouse over the label or click a small icon next to it and have a small tooltip explaining that this is the Debt:Equity ration and it is used as a measure of how many liabilites the company has, and that this information is derived from the Core financial statements. with a link or other reference for further reading regarding this data point.
