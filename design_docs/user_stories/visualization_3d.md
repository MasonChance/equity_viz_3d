# Visualisation, 3D Rendering and Charts

As a user that struggles with understanding relational data in purely numeric/formulaic format, I would like to be able to view any chart or collection of charts in a navigable 3D format whereby I can "move through the charts" on the "Z" axis (time) and better identify apparent patterns and correlations.

I should have the ability to hide/show datapoints as well as to mouse over a data point in the rendering and see a tooltip describing which set of data or chart the point originated from. 

I would like the option to annotate within this 3d virtualization and draw connections or delineate groupings between and among the datapoints depicted in this manner.

This 3D rendering should open in a seperate window to the main application interface and other more traditional charts being displayed.
