# General Use and the GUI

As a User I would like a desktop application that allows me to access information regarding both fundamental and technical data of a given equity traded on the U.S. Stock Exchanges. The information should include but not be limited to:

- CandleStick of performance (day, week, month, 3 month, 6 month, 1yr, 5yr)

- High-Low, Volume, open, close, apy, dividends, yeild, Sector, Industry.

- D/E ration, Book ration, EPS, shares outstanding, beta, SMA50, SMA200

- Financial Reports, (Cashflow Statement, Income Statement, Balance Sheet)

- SEC filings, Earnings Call Transcripts, Annual Reports.

I should be able to view this information in seperable, adjustable windows and easily navigate between information for cross referencing and comparison.
