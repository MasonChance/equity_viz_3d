# Equity_viz_3D Project Overview

The equity_viz_3d project is a desktop application designed to be used in the stock and equity analysis space, for the purpose of finding, plotting and examining relevant data in a 3-Dimensional format. Included are the ability to run various regression analyses, create custom data points derived from the base data, as well as develop and back-test various trading strategies against the historical performance of a given equity.

The project is being developed by a single developer [Mason Fryberger](www.linkedin.com/in/mason-fryberger-ghub-mason-chance) and is meant to be a useful tool for people with an interest in stock valuation and investing without the high cost barrier of most online tools and applications in the space; as well as serving to further develop his own skills and understanding of data analysis, data visualization and investment portfolio management.

As the project is still in early development, no liscencing has been attached and the project is not open source at this time. If you are interested in the project for whatever reason or would like to submit a code review regarding the latest commit, please contact mason.fryberger@gmail.com with "equity_viz_3d" in the subject line and a breif overview of your interest in the project.
